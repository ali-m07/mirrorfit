# Softwear

Softwear is a real-time virtual try-on platform built with React, Three.js, and Mediapipe. It uses live camera input to map user body motion, apply digital clothing models, and simulate realistic drape and movement in 3D.

## Overview
![Screenshot](readme_images/screenshot1.png)


Softwear blends computer vision, CGI, and physics-based rendering to let users experience virtual garments directly in the browser.  
It tracks body pose using Mediapipe, maps it to a 3D mesh, and dynamically overlays clothing assets with real-time physics and lighting.

## Core Features

- Live body tracking using Mediapipe and ONNX Runtime
- Realistic 3D garment overlays with Three.js and WebGL shaders
- Cloth physics simulation via WebAssembly-based engine
- Compressed GLTF/DRACO model loading from `/public/models`
- Integrated webcam access over HTTPS
- Modular React components for garment and camera control
